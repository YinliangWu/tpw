静夜思

李白

 

床前明月光，疑是地上霜。

举头望明月，低头思故乡。

 

Thoughts on a Quiet Night

Li Po

 

The moon shines on my bed brightly,

So that I mistook it for frost on the ground.

I gaze at the moonlight with head uplifted;

Now my head droops, and my thoughts turn homeward.

 

（刘师舜 译）

 

Still Night’s Muse

Li Bai

 

Afront the bed the Luna beams bright,

Wearing a look of seemingly rime white.

Eyes upcast toward the Luna,

Eyes downcast, engenders my nostalgia.

 

（黄龙 译）

 

Moonlight Night

Li Po

 

Before the couch moonlight came.

I had thought it frost on the ground.

Looking up, I gazed on the moon,

And bowed my head with thoughts of home.

 

（林如斯 译）

 

Looking at the Moon

Li Bai

 

Before my bed the moon shone brightly.

I thought it was frost.

I lifted my head and looked at the moon.

When I lowered my head I thought of home.

 

（王克难 译）

 

Quiet Night Thought

Li Bo

 

Before my bed the moonlight glitters

Like frost upon the ground.

I look up to the mountain moon,

Look down and think of home.

 

（Stephen Owen 译）

 

In the Quiet Night

Li Bai

 

The floor before my bed is bright:

Moonlight – like hoarfrost – in my room.

I lift my head and watch the moon.

I drop my head and think of home.
