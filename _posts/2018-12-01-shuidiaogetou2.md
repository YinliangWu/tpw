水调歌头

苏轼

 

丙辰中秋，欢饮达旦，大醉，作此篇，兼怀子由。

 

明月几时有？

把酒问青天。

不知天上宫阙，

今夕是何年。

我欲乘风归去，

又恐琼楼玉宇，

高处不胜寒。

起舞弄清影，

何似在人间。

 

转朱阁，

低绮户，

照无眠。

不应有恨，

何事长向别时圆？

人有悲欢离合，

月有阴晴圆缺，

此事古难全。

但愿人长久，

千里共婵娟。

 

Prelude to Water Melody

Su Shi

 

How long will the full moon appear?

Wine cup in hand, I ask the sky.

I do not know what time of the year

’T would be tonight in the palace on high.

Riding the wind, there I would fly,

Yet I’m afraid the crystalline palace would be

Too high and cold for me.

I rise and dance, with my shadow I play.

On high as on earth, would it be as gay?

 

The moon goes round the mansions red

Through gauze-draped window to shed

Her light upon the sleepless bed.

Against man she should have no spite.

Why then when people part, is she oft full and bright?

Men have sorrow and joy; they part or meet again;

The moon is bright or dim and she may wax or wane.

There has been nothing perfect since the olden days.

So let us wish that man

Will live long as he can!

Though miles apart, we’ll share the beauty she displays.

 

（许渊冲 译）

 

To “Water Song”

Su Shi

 

At the Mid-Autumn Festival in the year Bing-chen (1076) I enjoyed myself by drinking until dawn and became very drunk. I wrote this poem, thinking of Ziyou.

 

Bright moon, when wast thou made?

Holding my cup, I ask of the blue sky.

I know not in heaven’s palaces

What year it is this night.
I long to ride the wind and return;

Yet fear that marble towers and jade houses,

So high, are over-cold.

I rise and dance and sport with limpid shades;

Better far to be among mankind.

 

Around the vermillion chamber,

Down in the silken windows,

She shines on the sleepless,

Surely with no ill-will.

Why then is the time of parting always at full moon?

Man has grief and joy, parting and reunion;

The moon has foul weather and fair, waxing and waning.

In this since ever there has been no perfection.

All I can wish is that we may have long life,

That a thousand miles apart we may share her beauty.

 

（Robert Kotewell & Norman Smith 译）

 

Tune: “Prelude to Water Music”

Su Shi

 

On mid-autumn night of the yea bing-chen (1076), I drank merrily until dawn, got very drunk and wrote this poem, all the while thinking longingly of Ziyou.

 

Bright moon, when did you appear?

Lifting my wine, I question the blue sky.

Tonight in the palaces and halls of heaven

what year is it, I wonder?

I would like to ride the wind, make my home there,

only I fear in porphyry towers, under jade eaves,

in those high places the cold would be more than I could bear.

So I rise and dance and play with your pure beams,

though this human world C how can it compare with yours?

 

Circling my red chamber,

low in the curtained door,

you light my sleeplessness.

Surely you bear us no ill will C

why must you be so round at times when we humans are parted?

People have their griefs and joys, their joining and separations,

the moon its dark and clear times, its roundings and wanings.

As ever in such matters, things are hardly the way we wish.

I only hope we may have long long lives,

may share the moon’s beauty, though a thousand miles apart.

 

（Burton Watson 译）

 

Mid-Autumn Festival C To the Tune of Shuidiaogetou

Su Shi

 

Mid-Autumn Festival. I drank in jubilation from evening till dawn. Intoxicated by wine, I wrote this piece, and thought of Ziyou, my brother, as well.

 

How often can we have

such a glorious moon?

Raising my goblet, I put

 the question to Heaven.

Which year is it tonight,

 in your celestial palaces?

I wish to ride the wind, and

 return there, if not deterred

By the unbearable cold that must

 prevail at that precarious height.

Aloof there, one could dance

 but with a lonely shadow;

So why not

 stay on this Earth?

Hovering round my chamber,

Sidling through my window,

 a witness to my sleepless night.

You must bear no grudge,

 but why should you turn so full

Every time when somebody’s away?

This is, anyway, an eternal flaw C

 an uncertain world

 under an inconstant moon.

Nonetheless, may all of us remain

 long in this world, and share

The immortal moon even though

 thousands of miles apart!

 

（朱纯深 译）
