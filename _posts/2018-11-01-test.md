昔时贤文，诲汝谆谆，
集韵增文，多见多闻。
观今宜鉴古，无古不成今。 

The wisdom of ancient aphorisms
Has been instructing people earnestly,
This expanded poetic collection of them
Can add knowledge to your philosophy.
Consult history when observing reality,
Reality does not exist without history.

贤乃国之宝，儒乃席上珍。
农工与商贾，皆宜敦五伦。
孝弟为先务，本立而道生。
尊师以重道，爱众而亲仁。

In a country,
The learned virtuous and capable people 
Should be the most valuable;
At a feast, the talents of learned people
Should be the most desirable.
To educate farmers, workers and businessmen,
Are the five ethical principles*.
Filial duty and brotherhood
Are the most important,
As in forming a theory,
The core is fundamental.
Respect teachers and value their instruction,
Love the ordinary and live closely
With benevolent people.

* These are about the relationship between a monarch and his officials, a father and his children, a husband and his wife, the relationship between brothers and the relationship between friends.

钱财如粪土，仁义值千金。
做事须循天理，出言要顺人心。
心术不可得罪于天地，
言行要留好样与儿孙。
除富贵地，要矜怜贫贱的痛痒；
当少壮时，须体念衰老的酸辛。

Money and wealth are pure emptiness,
Humanity and justice are truly priceless.
Behave in accordance with heavenly purposes,
Speak to comply with popular wishes. 
Your intentions 
Should not offend heaven and earth;
For the sake of your descendants,
Your words and deeds should set a good example.
If rich and noble,
You should pity the hardships
Of the poor and humble;
When young and vigorous,
You should understand the difficulties
Of the old and feeble.

孝当竭力，非徒养身。
鸦有反哺之孝，羊知跪乳之恩。
岂无远道思亲泪，不及高堂念子心。
爱日以承欢，莫待丁兰刻木祀；
椎牛而祭墓，不如鸡豚逮亲存。

Mere support of your parents is not enough,
You should do your utmost to be dutiful.
A crow feeds its parents when they are old,
A lamb kneels down
When sucking milk from its mother,
Because it has gratitude to show.
Do people travelling far away
Not miss their parents?
Yet parents at home 
Worry more about their absent children.
Cherish your parents' remaining years
And make them happy,
Ding Lan's carving of wood portraits
For his parents after their death
Is not a good example.
Killing a bull to offer at your parents' graves
Is not as good as serving them chicken and pork
Before they are decrepit and old.
